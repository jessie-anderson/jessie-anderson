    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <div>
      Tune Me uses pitch detection and Android's sound card to tell users how
      accurate their singing is. Users press a start button, begin singing,
      and then press a stop button when they are done recording. The app will
      display their overall note accuracy for that recording, as well as a color bar representing how accurate they were at each point in the song. The colors will be a spectrum ranging from red for bad, to yellow for mediocre, to green for accurate. The color bar will have a slider that users can drag to any point in the recording that they want to listen to. Users will be able to save or delete the recording; if they choose to save the recording, they will be able to name the file. Saved recordings will be available in the app for users to pull up and listen to at any time.

      This app will require several technologies, some that are native to Android,
      some that require access to the device's hardware,
      and some that will require our own implementation. We will have to
      determine which pitch detection algorithm we will use and then implement
      it. Once we have the note accuracy for an entire song, we will need to
      implement a way to map pitch accuracy onto the color bar spectrum.
      In addition, we will need to use Android's sound card API to capture
      and save audio. Finally, we will be using external storage to save
      the recordings and the SQLite database to save information about the
      recordings, including the file name, the overall pitch accuracy, and the
      accuracy at each point in the song.
